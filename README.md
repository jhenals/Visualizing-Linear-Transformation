# Visualizing-Linear-Transformation
This is my very first university project. I used Python as programming language and Numpy and Turtle Modules of Python. This simple application resolves the Linear Transformation of a vector and demonstrate it visually in a two- dimensional Euclidean space. 

In this application, user will provide the coordinate values of the vector and the 2x2 matrix. The value of the Linear transformation will be calculated using Numpy while the position of the result will be drawn using Turtle.

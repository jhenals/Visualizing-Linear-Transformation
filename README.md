# Visualizing-Linear-Transformation

## Overview
This is my very first university project for my Fundamentals of Computer Science class (AA 2019-2022). 
In this simple project, I used Python as programming language, and Numpy and Turtle modules.

## How to use
This simple application resolves the Linear Transformation of a vector and demonstrate the result visually in a two-dimensional Euclidean space. 

In this application, user will provide the coordinate values of the vector (preferably between (-5,5) and the 2x2 matrix. The value of the Linear transformation will be calculated using Numpy while the position of the result will be drawn using Turtle.
